I am building this project and it will take a while before it is usable

G2D is a bridge between GStreamer framework and Pascal. 

G2D enables Delphi (pascal) developers to use the GStreamer framework in their pascal program. By doing so G2D enables endless manipulation and uses of multimedia on Windows, Linux, Mac, ios and Android systems. Because GStreamer was unavailable for Delphi developers many professional multimedia project development used C, C++, Python and Java (that do have bridges to GStreamer) all though in all other aspects Delphi would be their preferred choice.
